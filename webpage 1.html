        <h2>GLOBAL WARMING</h2>
        <P>
            Global warming, the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near the surface of Earth over the past one to two centuries. Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered detailed observations of various weather phenomena (such as temperatures, precipitation, and storms) and of related influences on climate (such as ocean currents and the atmosphere’s chemical composition). These data indicate that Earth’s climate has changed over almost every conceivable timescale since the beginning of geologic time and that human activities since at least the beginning of the Industrial Revolution have a growing influence over the pace and extent of present-day climate change.

        <h2>The influences of human activity on climate</h2>
        <p>
            Human activity has influenced global surface temperatures by changing the radiative balance governing the Earth on various timescales and at varying spatial scales. The most profound and well-known anthropogenic influence is the elevation of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Humans also influence climate by changing the concentrations of aerosols and ozone and by modifying the land cover of Earth’s surface.

        <p>
            Global warming and climate change have the potential to alter biological systems. More specifically, changes to near-surface air temperatures will likely influence ecosystem functioning and thus the biodiversity of plants, animals, and other forms of life.

        <p>
            Modern research into climatic variation and change is based on a variety of empirical and theoretical lines of inquiry. One line of inquiry is the analysis of data that record changes in atmosphere, oceans, and climate from roughly 1850 to the present. In a second line of inquiry, information describing paleoclimatic changes is gathered from “proxy,” or indirect, sources such as ocean and lake sediments, pollen grains, corals, ice cores, and tree rings. Finally, a variety of theoretical models can be used to investigate the behaviour of Earth’s climate under different conditions. These three lines of investigation are described in this section.
